This is a demo full stack website I've made. It uses React and the react-router-dom for an interconnected dynamic website. The site looks great on PC monitors and phone to tablet screens. With compatibility and dynamic design at the forefront from day one. The color pallet the image assets are themed around a zen meditation studio. Though not my own.
